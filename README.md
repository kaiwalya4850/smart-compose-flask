# smart-compose-flask
Smart compose messages/emails using Flask
This project won't include integration with web, rather it'll have a function that returns predicted text. This value could be further used anywhere!

Dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset
Smart_Compose_final.ipynb : Main notebook used to train everything
load_and_test.ipynb : Used to test(Locate the models directory correctly and run the cells in given order)

Integration with Flask coming soon!
